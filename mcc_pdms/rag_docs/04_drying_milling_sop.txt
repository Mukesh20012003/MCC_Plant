Drying and Milling SOP – MCC Plant

Objective:
To define the standard procedure for drying and milling MCC wet cake into finished product.

Scope:
Applies to all MCC batches after washing and dewatering.

Key quality targets:
- Moisture within specified range.
- Particle size distribution within specification.
- Free-flowing, non-caking powder.

Drying:

1. Pre-start checks
- Inspect dryer for cleanliness and mechanical readiness.
- Confirm correct filters and screens are installed.
- Check that temperature controllers and safety interlocks are functional.

2. Feeding wet cake
- Confirm solids content of wet cake is within the expected range.
- Feed the wet cake at a controlled rate to avoid overloading the dryer.
- Avoid large lumps where possible; break them before feeding.

3. Dryer operation
- Set inlet and outlet temperature setpoints per recipe.
- Monitor air temperature and product temperature at defined intervals.
- Adjust feed rate and air flow to maintain stable operation.
- Record key parameters in the batch record.

4. Moisture monitoring
- Take in-process samples as the batch approaches completion.
- Measure moisture using the approved method.
- Continue drying until the target moisture range is achieved.

Milling:

1. Mill setup
- Select the correct mill type and screen size based on product grade.
- Verify that the mill is clean and free of foreign material.
- Set mill speed and feed rate as per standard settings.

2. Milling operation
- Feed dried material steadily to the mill to avoid choking.
- Monitor mill current and temperature for signs of overload.
- Collect milled product and direct it to sieving.

3. Sieving and classification
- Use appropriate sieve stack to remove overs and fines if required.
- Recycle oversize material to the mill when allowed.
- Collect in-spec product for final packing.

4. Final checks
- Verify particle size distribution on a representative sample.
- Check bulk density and flow properties if applicable.
- If results are out of spec, evaluate options for rework according to procedure.

Safety:
- Control dust using extraction systems to reduce explosion risk.
- Do not open access doors while the dryer or mill is running.
- Use appropriate PPE for dust environments.
