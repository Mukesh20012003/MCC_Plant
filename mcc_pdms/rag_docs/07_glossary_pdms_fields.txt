MCC PDMS Glossary and Field Definitions

Batch number (batch_no):
- Unique identifier for a production batch of MCC.
- Used to link manufacturing records and QC results.

Raw material:
- The primary cellulose source used for MCC production.
- Typically purified alpha-cellulose from an approved supplier.

Status:
- RUNNING: batch is currently in process.
- COMPLETED: batch has finished all processing steps.
- FAILED: batch has been rejected or terminated.

Start time and end time:
- Timestamps for the beginning and completion of batch processing.
- Used to analyze cycle time and equipment utilization.

QC report:
- A record containing analytical test results for a batch.
- Linked to the batch via a foreign key relationship.

Predicted outcome:
- Result from an ML model indicating if the batch is likely to pass or fail QC.
- Does not replace actual QC; used for early warning.

Predicted probability:
- Probability score between 0 and 1 indicating model confidence.
- Higher values closer to 1 indicate higher confidence for the predicted class.

Anomaly score:
- A numeric score from an anomaly detection model.
- Higher scores indicate that the batch behavior is less typical compared to historical data.

Anomaly flag (is_anomaly):
- Boolean flag derived from the anomaly score.
- true: batch is considered anomalous and may need review.
- false: batch appears normal.

RAG document:
- A text document stored in the RAG index.
- Used by the assistant to answer questions about MCC process and quality.

RAG chunk:
- A small section of a document used for retrieval.
- Each chunk has its own embedding vector to support semantic search.
