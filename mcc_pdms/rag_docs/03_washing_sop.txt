Washing and Neutralization SOP – MCC Plant

Objective:
To define the procedure for washing and neutralizing MCC slurry after hydrolysis.

Scope:
Applies to all MCC batches transferred from the hydrolysis reactor to the washing section.

Key objectives of washing:
- Remove residual acid from the hydrolyzed slurry.
- Reduce soluble impurities.
- Adjust pH and conductivity to defined limits.

Equipment:
- Washing tanks or filters
- Agitators
- Pumps and valves for wash water and filtrate
- pH and conductivity meters

Procedure:

1. Receiving slurry
- Confirm that the correct batch is being transferred from the reactor.
- Record initial slurry temperature and pH.

2. First wash
- Add the specified volume of wash water to the slurry.
- Start agitation and mix for the defined time.
- Allow solids to settle or use filtration to separate filtrate.
- Measure pH and conductivity of the filtrate.
- Record results in the batch record.

3. Additional washes
- If pH and conductivity are not within the target range, perform additional washes.
- For each wash, repeat the same steps: add water, mix, separate, measure, and record.
- Do not exceed the maximum number of washes without supervisor approval.

4. Neutralization
- If required, add neutralizing agent slowly under agitation.
- Monitor pH during addition to avoid overshoot.
- Target final slurry pH within the defined range (for example, 6.0–7.5).
- Record the amount of neutralizing agent used.

5. Final checks
- Confirm that final wash filtrate conductivity is below the specified limit.
- Verify pH of the washed slurry is within the acceptable range.
- If parameters are out of range, inform supervisor and follow deviation procedure.

6. Transfer to dewatering
- Once washed and neutralized, transfer the slurry to the dewatering equipment.
- Record transfer details in the batch record.

Safety:
- Handle chemicals according to their safety data sheets.
- Avoid direct contact with acidic or alkaline solutions.
- Ensure good ventilation around wash and neutralization tanks.
