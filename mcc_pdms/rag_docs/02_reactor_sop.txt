Hydrolysis Reactor SOP – MCC Plant

Objective:
To describe the standard operating procedure for running the MCC hydrolysis reactor safely and consistently.

Scope:
This SOP applies to all MCC production batches processed in the hydrolysis reactor.

Responsibilities:
- Operators: Execute the procedure, record data, and report deviations.
- Supervisors: Verify operations and review batch records.
- QA: Review deviations and approve batch disposition.

Pre-start checks:
- Verify the reactor is clean and status is "Ready for Use".
- Confirm that all valves in the process line-up match the standard configuration.
- Check availability of raw materials: alpha-cellulose, water, and acid.
- Confirm that all safety interlocks and alarms are functional.

Charging raw materials:
- Charge purified alpha-cellulose to the reactor according to the batch sheet.
- Add process water to the specified volume or mass.
- Slowly dose acid while maintaining agitation to avoid localized overheating.
- Confirm that the reactor manway is properly closed and sealed.

Reaction conditions:
- Set the reactor temperature setpoint as per the batch recipe.
- Start agitation at the recommended speed for uniform mixing.
- Once target temperature is reached, start the reaction timer.
- Record temperature, pressure, and agitation speed at defined intervals.
- Monitor for abnormal trends such as rapid temperature rise or pressure spikes.

In-process checks:
- Take in-process samples if required by the batch record.
- Check slurry appearance and viscosity, if applicable.
- If any parameter goes out of range, follow the deviation procedure.

End of reaction:
- At the end of the reaction time, stop heating and adjust conditions as required.
- Confirm that safety interlocks are still healthy.
- Transfer the reactor contents to the washing section using the designated transfer line.
- Document transfer start and end times.

Shutdown and cleaning:
- After batch transfer, flush the reactor with water to remove residual solids.
- Perform cleaning as per the cleaning SOP if a full clean is required.
- Update equipment status to "Cleaned" or "Ready" as appropriate.

Safety precautions:
- Always wear the required PPE including acid-resistant gloves, goggles, and apron.
- Never open the reactor under pressure or at elevated temperature.
- Ensure that the acid dosing system has appropriate backflow prevention.
- In case of acid spill, follow the site spill response procedure.
