Typical Setpoints and Operating Limits – MCC Plant

Note:
Actual values must be taken from the approved process specification. The ranges below are generic examples for training and troubleshooting.

Reactor operating conditions:
- Charge temperature: typically 20–35 °C.
- Reaction temperature: for example 60–80 °C, held within ±2 °C of setpoint.
- Reaction time: defined per recipe, for example 30–90 minutes.
- Agitation speed: set to ensure uniform mixing without excessive foaming.

Key reactor limits:
- Maximum allowable temperature: do not exceed the validated maximum (example 90 °C).
- Maximum pressure: must remain below vessel design pressure.
- pH after hydrolysis: typically acidic; follow the specified range to ensure proper degree of polymerization.

Washing and neutralization:
- Wash filtrate conductivity target: below a defined limit (for example < 500 µS/cm).
- Final slurry pH after neutralization: typically near neutral (for example 6.0–7.5).
- Maximum number of wash cycles: defined in the batch record to balance quality and efficiency.

Dewatering:
- Target wet cake solids: for example 25–40 % w/w.
- Too low solids:
  - Increases dryer load and energy consumption.
- Too high solids:
  - Can make cake difficult to convey or break up.

Dryer operating conditions:
- Inlet air temperature: for example 120–160 °C depending on dryer type and grade.
- Outlet air temperature: for example 70–90 °C.
- Product temperature: must stay within safe limits to avoid degradation.
- Typical drying time: depends on dryer, feed rate, and initial moisture.

Dryer limits:
- Do not exceed maximum inlet temperature defined in the process specification.
- Monitor for rapid changes in outlet temperature, which may indicate feed or heater issues.

Milling and sieving:
- Mill speed: set according to equipment capability and desired particle size.
- Screen size: chosen based on product grade.
- Typical aim: 90% of particles below a specified size (for example 180 µm).
- Avoid feeding large, hard lumps that may damage the mill or cause overloads.

Quality-related limits:
- Moisture:
  - Below lower limit: risk of excessive fines and dust.
  - Above upper limit: risk of caking and stability issues.
- Bulk density:
  - Outside specified range may affect downstream handling and customer performance.
- Appearance:
  - Significant color change or visible contamination requires investigation.

Use of limits in troubleshooting:
- When problems occur, check actual values against these ranges.
- Identify which parameter deviated first in time.
- Link deviations to alarms, equipment issues, or raw material changes.
- Use this information along with troubleshooting guides to determine corrective actions.
