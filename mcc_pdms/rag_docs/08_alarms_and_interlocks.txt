Alarms and Interlocks – MCC Plant

Objective:
To describe typical alarms and interlocks in the MCC plant and how operators should respond.

Alarm categories:
- Critical alarms: Events that may directly affect safety, environment, or product quality.
- High-priority alarms: Significant process deviations that require timely action.
- Low-priority alarms: Minor deviations or status notifications.

Reactor alarms:

1. Reactor high temperature alarm
- Description: Reactor temperature exceeds the high alarm setpoint.
- Possible causes:
  - Excessive heating or controller malfunction.
  - Inadequate cooling or blocked jacket flow.
- Interlocks and actions:
  - Heater output may be automatically reduced or cut off.
  - Operator must check steam/thermal fluid valves and jacket flow.
  - If temperature continues to rise, initiate controlled shutdown.

2. Reactor overpressure alarm
- Description: Reactor pressure exceeds the high alarm limit.
- Possible causes:
  - Gas generation during reaction.
  - Blocked vent or condenser.
- Interlocks and actions:
  - Pressure relief or vent valves may open automatically.
  - Operator must verify vent path and condenser operation.
  - Do not open manway until pressure is within safe range.

3. Reactor agitator failure
- Description: Agitator stops or current drops below threshold.
- Possible causes:
  - Motor trip, mechanical jam, or power loss.
- Actions:
  - Stop charging of raw materials and acid.
  - Inform maintenance and supervisor.
  - Assess impact on batch homogeneity and quality.

Dryer and milling alarms:

1. Dryer inlet temperature high
- Description: Inlet air temperature above upper limit.
- Possible causes:
  - Controller setpoint error.
  - Fuel or heater malfunction.
- Actions:
  - Reduce setpoint or shut down heater as per procedure.
  - Check temperature sensors and controllers.
  - Inspect product for signs of discoloration or degradation.

2. Dryer outlet temperature low
- Description: Outlet temperature below the normal operating range.
- Possible causes:
  - Excessive wet feed.
  - Reduced heat input or air flow.
- Actions:
  - Reduce feed rate to the dryer.
  - Check heating system and air flow.
  - Monitor product moisture more frequently.

3. Mill overload alarm
- Description: Mill current or torque above limit.
- Possible causes:
  - Excessive feed rate or very hard lumps.
  - Screen blockage or worn internals.
- Actions:
  - Immediately reduce feed rate to the mill.
  - If alarm persists, stop the mill and inspect internals.
  - Remove foreign objects or oversize lumps before restart.

Dust and extraction alarms:

1. Dust collector differential pressure high
- Description: Pressure across filter is too high.
- Possible causes:
  - Filter bags loaded or blocked.
  - Discharge valve stuck or full hopper.
- Actions:
  - Check hopper discharge and empty if required.
  - Inspect filters for damage or blinding.
  - Do not continue operation with severe dust issues.

2. Extraction fan failure
- Description: Airflow or fan status alarm.
- Possible causes:
  - Motor trip.
  - Mechanical failure.
- Actions:
  - Stop feeding dusty equipment (mill, conveyor).
  - Investigate fan and restart only when safe.

General alarm handling procedure:
- Acknowledge the alarm in the control system.
- Read alarm text and associated parameter values.
- Compare with normal operating ranges and recent trends.
- Follow the specific runbook or SOP for that alarm type.
- Record actions and observations in the shift log and batch record if relevant.
