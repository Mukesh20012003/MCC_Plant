Troubleshooting Common MCC Batch Issues

High final moisture:
- Possible causes:
  - Insufficient drying time.
  - Low dryer inlet temperature.
  - Wet feed with higher-than-normal moisture.
- Recommended actions:
  - Extend drying duration while monitoring product temperature.
  - Increase inlet air temperature within safe limits.
  - Check dewatering performance and wet cake solids.

Low moisture but poor flow:
- Possible causes:
  - Over-drying leading to excessive fines.
  - Agglomeration in the dryer followed by aggressive milling.
- Recommended actions:
  - Reduce dryer outlet temperature or time.
  - Optimize mill speed and screen to balance particle size.

Off-spec bulk density:
- Low bulk density:
  - Excessive fines and porous particles.
  - Inadequate compaction during processing.
- High bulk density:
  - Oversized particles or strong agglomerates.
- Recommended actions:
  - Adjust milling conditions and screen size.
  - Review drying profile and sieve configuration.

Frequent QC failures:
- Check recent changes in raw material lots and COAs.
- Review reactor temperature, reaction time, and acid concentration.
- Examine washing cycles, pH control, and conductivity endpoints.
- Verify dryer and mill setpoints and maintenance status.

Color or appearance issues:
- Yellow or dark product may indicate:
  - Overheating during drying.
  - Impurities in raw materials or process water.
- Actions:
  - Review temperature trends and hotspots in dryer.
  - Check raw material and water quality.

General troubleshooting approach:
- Start with a review of batch records and trends.
- Identify any deviations or alarms during the batch.
- Compare with a reference “good” batch.
- Involve production, QC, and QA for complex investigations.
