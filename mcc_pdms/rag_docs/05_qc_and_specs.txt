MCC QC Testing and Specifications

Objective:
To define the key quality control (QC) tests and acceptance criteria for MCC batches.

Final product tests:
- Moisture: typically 2.0–5.0 % w/w depending on grade.
- Bulk density: specified range such as 0.25–0.45 g/mL.
- Particle size distribution: for example, 90% passing 180 µm.
- Appearance: white to off-white, free-flowing powder.
- Any additional tests required by the customer or pharmacopoeia.

In-process QC:
- After hydrolysis: pH and visual appearance of slurry.
- After washing: filtrate conductivity and pH.
- After drying: product temperature and preliminary moisture checks.
- During milling: visual check for uniformity and absence of foreign particles.

Sampling:
- Use the approved sampling plan to take representative samples.
- Label all samples with batch number, sample point, and date.
- Store and handle samples to avoid contamination or moisture change.

Specifications:
- Each parameter must meet its defined specification range.
- Specifications are documented in the MCC finished product specification sheet.
- Any out-of-specification (OOS) result must be investigated.

Batch release rules:
- All mandatory QC tests must be completed and within specification.
- OOS or out-of-trend (OOT) results require documented investigation.
- QA must approve any rework or disposition decision.
- Batches failing critical safety or microbiological tests cannot be reworked.

Documentation:
- Record all test methods, results, and analyst details in QC records.
- Attach certificates of analysis (COA) to each released batch.
- Retain records as per regulatory and company requirements.
